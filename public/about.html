<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, I'm Awosola Olakunle, a multi-talented human specializing in the design, creation  and development of 
  digital products.
  With a career spanning over 8years, I have demonstrated my proficiency across various design disciplines, such as 
  creative director, advisor, enterpreneur, front-end developer,graphics enthusiast, portrait/wedding photographer
  and many more.
</p>I believe in defining myself not by my past work, but by the work I aspire to accomplish. I value continuous 
learning, self-challenge, and meaningful pursuits. Fueled by high energy and boundless enthusiasm, I am easily 
inspired and always eager to follow my passions. My diverse interests, hobbies, and areas of study fuel my passion 
for creativity and innovation. I am a fast learner, capable of acquiring new skills and managing multiple projects 
with ease. I strive to develop expertise in several areas throughout my life and career.

<p>As a people-oriented professional with deep emotions and empathy, I am a natural storyteller. I find fulfillment
   in inspiring others and am at my best when sharing my creative expressions. My current focus revolves on enhancing 
   the visual and functional elements of product user interfaces and experiences, emphasizing strategy, vision, research, 
   advisory, and leadership roles. Aligning business goals with customer needs, focusing on digital products, user interface, 
   user experience, and managing end-to-end design initiatives. Actively seeking to broaden my responsibilities, I thrive on 
   tackling diverse challenges within the dynamic design landscape.
